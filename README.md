# Anki Multi Language Template (WIP)
This is a custom vocabulary learning template designed for Anki. This was made to learn 3 languages at the same time in order to maximize productivity and progress.

> Note: This template only works for Windows (for now)
> THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING IS RELEASED.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

I'm not a native English speaker but I often watch movies, series and videos with subtitles. And one problem I constantly face is new words or expressions comming up which meaning I don't recognize. So I need to go look them up online.

However, I'm sick of having to go to the dictionary to look up the meaning of words because I forget the meanings if I don't practice or see the words in real life examples. And so I thought that a good way to learn vocabulary would be with Anki flashcards, but most of the templates that exist don't have the information I want nor are they very appealing. That's why I created this template that follows 4 principles that make learning more effective.

- **Visual definition** - It's known that human brains process images much faster than words. With visual information over translation, foreign words build associations with the actual object instead of a word in a language you already know, this bypasses the processes of having to think of a word and then its translation.
- **Less is more** - When reviewing, fields such as example sentences and definitions are collapsed by default to reduce visual cluttering, while translations are hidden as a second-level hint. By doing so, you can focus on trying to recollect what you want to remember instead of getting distracted.
- **Speech synthesis** - Built-in audio speech
- **Good looking** - It has to look nice :) The style was inspired by NSBum's Anki Solarized Light theme.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

If you want to have exactly the same look as my anki software just follow these steps.

**1.** Download the `MultiLang-Template.apkg` and open it.  
**2.** Go to Anki preferences and enable "Night Mode" checkbox.  
**3.** A deck was created. Click on the settings icon > Options and toggle "Don't play audio automatically".  
**4.** Install [Anki-redesign](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/308574457) add-on and apply Poppins font in configuration window.
